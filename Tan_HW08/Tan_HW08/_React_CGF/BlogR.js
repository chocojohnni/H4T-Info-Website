                Click <a target="_blank" href= "json/h4t.json">HERE</a> to see my JSON data!
                My JSON file contains data fields such as songID, song, people, officeMembers,
                teamH, teamT, staffTeam, and a link providing an image correlating to all the
                data fields. Each of the data fields vary depending on the song that is included
                by the link. As you are redirected by clicking on the link, you'll see the
                difference in the data fields! It may seem a bit confusing at first, but if try looking
                through the image links first and then looking at the data fields, everything will
                start to make sense.

                My Web Development Experience

            <p>
                After diving into the web development world, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS.
                I have learned how to create a website from a few sample codes and how to style it to my liking.
                For example, I was able to play around with some of the padding, width size, and font size
                to make my website look more appealing. I also learned how to create a JSON file and link it using
                an anchor tag. In the JSON file, I was able to create data fields and link them to a specific song.
                I was able to link the JSON file to my website and have it redirect to the JSON file. Overall, my
                web development experience has been going great so far and I believe that this is only the start of my
                journey of becoming a web developer.

                A part of the homework that I found easy was referencing internal and external links.
                I was able to implement the "H4T" photo that you see in the middle of the page by
                downloading the image and referencing it in the HTML file. I also found the making
                of the JSON file pretty easy since it is pretty much straightforward. These were the two
                topics that I found less challenging than others, but there were some challenging parts as well. 
                A part of the homework that I found difficult was setting up the padding, border, and
                width size of the title, titleNav, and the footer. It was a little challenging when trying
                to make the titleNav responsive so that in narrow widths, the title and nav would be on 
                different rows and vice versa. What I found the most valuable in this about this homework
                assignment was just starting at the very base of this assignment. Since the homework is going
                to continue on throughtout the semester and become a project, starting to learn the basics of
                HTML and CSS is very important. Now that I have finished most of what was necessary prior to 
                Homework 1, I believe that I am ready to move on to Homework 2.

                This homework assignment was much shorter compared to the first homework assignment. 
                I'd say an obstacle that I came across was after I incorporated my style, the drop
                down content wasn't displaying anything. I came to realize that the color of the text
                was camoflouged with the backgrund color of the drop down menu. Another obstacle I camee
                across was trying to get my image to work. Since we transitioned over to React coding,
                my image source link wasn't able to work because of the inline styling. I was able to
                overcome this by creating an image source instead of a style. A couple easy things I found
                about this homework was that most of the code was already done for me. All I needed to do 
                was use my style instead of the sample code's style. I also had to change my titleNav
                and my footer to be different than the sample code's styling. Other than that, I believe
                I am ready to move on to Homework 3.

                This homework assignment was pretty challenging compared to the first and second homework
                assignments. The easiest part I found about this assignment was of course, the styling.
                In my opinion, the styling is pretty doable, it's just getting the right
                style that fits the standards of the criteria. Another part I found pretty easy was implmenting
                the select tags for the user to interact with the website. One part that I found challenging
                was making the reusable object function which was my MakeSong.JS. In my opinion, this was hard
                to me because this where all the functionality happens. Making sure that everything fits the
                criteria, it was still difficult to implment all the javascript code. Another part that was
                pretty difficult to me was making the content generating function. Not as difficult as the
                javascript object code but still pretty tedious in my opinion. Other than that, I believe 
                I am ready to move on to Homework 4.

                This homework assignment was a little less difficult because of how similar it was to the
                previous homework assignment. The previous assignment used JavaScript, this Homework
                assignment used React which made it pretty similar to the previous homework. The outcome
                was a little different this time, I couldn't get my song containers to propery align side-by-side
                horizontally like I did with the previous homework. I'd say that was the challenging part.
                Another challenging part was the MakeSongR function. I think this part of making an object
                is always the hardest. Luckily I was able to get through it from studying the code from the lab.
                The easiest part I found about this homework assignment was how similar the coding was
                compared to the JavaSript version. The only difference was the syntax of React but still having
                the same functionality as JavaScript. I've come to a conclusion that I personally enjoy React
                more than JavaScript. Overall, I believe that I am ready to move on to Homework 5.

                This homework assignment was a little more challenging than the previous homework assignment.
                The most challenging part I found about this assignment was the MakeSlideShow function. This was
                challenging because I had to make sure that the slideshow was able to loop back to the start and
                to the end. I also had to make sure that the slideshow was able to show the image, caption, and info
                of the song. The easiest part I found about this assignment was the styling. The styling was pretty
                easy to do because I was able to use the same styling as the previous homework assignment. I was
                also able to use the same styling as the lab. I believe that I am ready to move on to Homework 6.

                This homework assignment was pretty straightforward as it was pretty similar to the lab we completed
                on input components. The most challenging part I found about this assignment is the success and cancel
                function. This was challenging because I had to create a for loop that would iterate through all the
                inputSpecs so that it would display everything the user had input. The easiest part I found about this
                assignment was the process of populating and non-populating preset values. This was easy because for
                the population method it would just be the same as mathcing the values of the inputSpecs and putting it
                as userToEdit. Same with the non-populating one where you just leave it as an empty string. I was able
                to get throug this assignment because it was pretty similar to the lab and it wasn't that difficult to
                be honest. I believe that I am ready to move on to Homework 9.
