                We are H4T! A Philadelphia based dance cover group that is dedicated to spreading love and joy through dance.
                We are a non-profit organization, at the moment, but we are looking to expand our goals of becoming a profitable organization.
                H4T originated in 2019 with just four high school students who simply had a loving passion of dancing and covering K-pop songs.
                They then started to recruit more and more members and eventually expanding up to 40+ members!
                After 5 years, the office came up with the decision to host their own event called, H4T's Showcase Production, taking place in
                the Suzanne Roberts Theatre. Here is the entire video of the showcase, <a href="https://youtu.be/zBWReHhyFFA?si=aXPcx1J4TeOpHv9D"> H4T Showcase Production</a>.
