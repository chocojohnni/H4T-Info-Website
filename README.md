# H4T-Info-Website
This is one of my websites that is themed around a dance group called Hope 4 Tomorrow. It covers some of the songs that we're covered/performed and the members who were involved in the project. It also has information on the songs used in these projects illustrated through slideshows with buttons.

Inside this repository includes a folder of my entire project with inclusive folders like JavaScript, React, and Styling folders. Index.html is the main landing page of my website. It includes a navigation bar populated with different redirects and functionalities that is conveinient for the user to use.
